# SQUEAL!!! üêñ

As a full stack dev, I write SQL only occasionally. When I do it is typically simple queries, maybe with a join here or there. What's more, the standard of hiding all our database interactions behind ORMs makes writing actual SQL even less common and obfuscated by the syntax of the ORM in use.

ORMs come and go. Squel has staying power. Better stay sharp on the Squeal.

To that end, I have been chipping away at hackerrank sql queries. This is there home now.
