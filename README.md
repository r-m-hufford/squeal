# SQUEAL!!! üêñ

As a full stack dev, I feel like I write the same SQL over and over. These are typically simple queries, maybe with a join here or there. What's more, the common practice of abstracting all of our database interactions behind ORMs makes writing raw SQL even less common and obfuscates it with the syntax of the ORM in use.

To that end, I have been chipping away at hackerrank sql queries. This is their home now.
