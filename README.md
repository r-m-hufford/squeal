# SQUEAL!!! üêñ

As a full stack dev, I feel like I write the same SQL over and over. These are typically simple queries, maybe with a join here or there. What's more, the standard of abstracting all of our database interactions behind ORMs makes writing raw SQL even less common and obfuscates it by the syntax of the ORM in use.

ORMs come and go. Squel power is real power. Better stay sharp on the Squeal.

To that end, I have been chipping away at hackerrank sql queries. This is there home now.
